# Console_Battleship
Pretty simple to play, read instructions. Orientation of ships must be decided before ships are creted, because I got lazy, and didn't want to deal with rotation based edge cases. No AI, because I'm lazy. Used classes because I was going to create special ships like a sub, that would have extra abilities, but once again, I got lazy. Will come back to this at some stage.
